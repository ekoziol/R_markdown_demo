My First R Markdown File
========================

This is my first R markdown file

Here we go:

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data.
```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list:

- First Element
- Second Element
- Third Element

1. Who's on first?
2. *What's on Second?*
3. **I dunno, third base.**
